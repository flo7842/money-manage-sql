<p>The editor is actually fake, so you really can't do anything with it. It's basically just an interface with clickable buttons that do nothing. We threw it together to show how contextualized UI help looks. Just imagine how much cooler it would look in your application, though!</p>

<h3>You can customize titles</h3>

<h4>It was burgundy in the editor but now it's orange</h4>

<p>So, to read your&nbsp;email in the editor:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You can't.</li>
	<li>Go to another editor.<br />
	Thunderbird isn't perfect, but it's free so maybe try that.</li>
	<li>Configure everything.</li>
	<li>Fail.</li>
	<li>Take a deep breath.</li>
	<li>Go get coffee.</li>
	<li>Try again.</li>
	<li>Succeed.<br />
	<br />
	You can now read your email. Click the message name to display it.</li>
</ol>

<p>These instructions probably weren't enough, I'm very sorry. To make up for it, here is a nice sketch of a tardigrade.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tardigrades </strong>are the only creatures known to be able to survive the vacuum of space, which is not relevant to this demonstration but still pretty cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They're also called water bears, which I find misleading because they're very tiny, or moss piglets, which is somehow both gross and adorable. To sum up:</p>
